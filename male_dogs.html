      <p>Indy is my best buddy.  He loves to learn and train and strives to do whatever I ask of him.  Even when just relaxing around the house he constantly brings me toys, volunteering to play tug, fetch and catch.  He’s also a great guard dog, very protective of me, his baby ½ sister Jibaya and our property, with nothing happening that he doesn’t notice and alert to.  He has great stamina and loves to go for long walks/runs in the woods around our farm and anywhere else I take him.  He’s very versatile, always happy and fun-loving.  He earned the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) title at only 6 months of age, also has a Trick Dog Novice (TKN) title and is currently in IGP training.
        
Indy was born on March 1, 2020, has an OFA Normal heart, OFA Good hips and is DM clear.
