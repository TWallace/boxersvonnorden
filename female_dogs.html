      <p>Jibaya was born to work.  She’s harder, more serious and ferocious than her ½ brother Indy and never backs down from anything, coming back more enthusiastically the more she’s pushed.  She learns quickly and especially loves Protection work.  She’s extremely active and full of energy, seeming to never tire.  She loves long walks/runs in the woods around our farm and anywhere else, but sticks closer to me than Indy, enjoying interacting with me along the way more than exploring on her own.  She’s a very happy, healthy and beautiful girl who will produce outstanding working dogs.
        
Jibaya was born on June 19, 2021, has an OFA Normal heart, OFA Good hips, is DM and ARVC clear and has tested as homozygous brindle, meaning she has two copies of the brindle color gene so can only have brindle offspring.  She earned the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) title at only 5 months of age, also has a Trick Dog Novice (TKN) title and is currently in IGP training.

      Jibaya’s first breeding is to the flashy fawn V-Grobi vom Hafen, SchH1, FH2, ZTP, with puppies expected in early June, 2023.  Both flashy and plain brindles will be possible.  <a href="mailto:boxersvonnorden@gmail.com">Email</a> for more information and Puppy Applications!</p>
